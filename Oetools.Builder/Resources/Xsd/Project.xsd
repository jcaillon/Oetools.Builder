Remarks:
A project has:
- properties, that are used to describe your application (for instance, the database needed to compile) and are also used to describe options to build your application (for instance, if the compilation should also generate the xref files).
- variables, that make your build process dynamic. You can use variables almost anywhere in this xml and dynamically overload their values when running the build.
- build configurations, which describe a succession of tasks that build your application. Build configurations can also have their own properties and variables which will overload the ones defined at the project level.]]></xs:documentation>

A build configuration describe how to build your application.

Several build configurations can be defined for a single project.

Each build configuration can define "children" build configurations.
Each child inherits its parent properties following these rules:
