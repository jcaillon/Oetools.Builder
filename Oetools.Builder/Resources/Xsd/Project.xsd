Some facts:<br>
  - A project is composed of one or several build configurations.<br>
  - A build configuration describe how to build your project.<br>
  - To build your project, you need to specify which build configuration to use.<br>
            <br>
Below is a simplified representation of a project file:<br>

  │  │  └─ Child build configuration x...<br>
  │  └─ Child build configuration x...<br>
  └─ Build configuration x...<br>
<br>
There are no upper limit for build configuration nesting.<br>
The idea is that nested build configuration inherit properties from their parent, recursively (more details on the build configuration help).]]></xs:documentation>

  - Each build configuration can define "children" build configurations.<br>
  - Each child inherits its parent properties following these rules:<br>
  - For a given property, the most nested value is used (i.e. child value prioritized over parent value).<br>
  - If the xml element is a list, the elements of the child (if any) will be added to the elements of the parent (if any). For instance, the steps list has this behavior. This means that the steps of a child will be added to the defined steps of its parents.<br>

          <xs:documentation><![CDATA[Only on windows, try to hide the prowin.exe process from the windows task bar.<br>
<br>
For some reasons, the prowin.exe executable started in batch mode (-b) systematically creates a new window. That window is hidden but it still appears in the task bar. Weirdly enough, starting prowin.exe without the -b parameter does not show any window. However we need the batch mode to correctly redirect runtime errors (otherwise it should show the errors in an alert-box).<br>
As a workaround, we wait for the prowin.exe to start and to create its window and then we hide it using widows API so it does not appear in the task bar.<br>
This option might not be needed later on, if this behavior is fixed.<br>

An incremental build improves the build process by only compiling and building source files that were modified or added since the last build. It is the opposite of a full rebuild.<br>
<br>
- The incremental build only concerns source files handled in a source build step.<br>
- If true, a build history is stored (in .xml format) to be able to know which file has been modified/added since the last build.<br>
- An analysis is done on compiled files to find referenced tables and files.<br>
- The MD5 checksum of each source file can be computed and saved to improve modification detection.<br>
- Depending on your build and your intentions, this can significantly improve the build performances or slow down systematic full rebuilds.<br>

<br>
Some facts:<br>
  - Each step contains a list of tasks.<br>
  - The sequential execution of these steps/tasks is called a build.<br>
  - Steps (and tasks within them) are executed sequentially in the order they were defined.<br>
  - A child configuration inherit the steps of its parent: they are executed before its own steps.<br>
            <br>
There are 3 kinds of steps:<br>
  - 'BuildSource' with tasks that will handle the files in your source directory (for instance, to compile procedures or copy configuration files).<br>
  - 'BuildOutput' with tasks that will handle the files in the build output directory (for instance, to create a .zip release of compiled files).<br>
  - 'Free' with tasks that will handle files outside of your source or output directory (for instance, to download dependencies before the compilation).<br>
<br>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
  This build step is referred as 'free' because, contrary other type of build step, it does not require to list the files in the source/output directory prior to running the tasks.<br>
  Instead, tasks in this step can handle files that are not necessarily located in your source directory (nor in your output directory).<br>
  <br>
  Suggested usage:<br>
    - These tasks can be used to "prepare" a build: downloading dependencies/packages or modifying certain source files.<br>
    - These tasks can be used to "deploy" a build: uploading a release zip file to a distant http or ftp server.]]></xs:documentation>
